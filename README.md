# Real-World Data Cleaning

**Author:** Uttarayan Haldar
**Objective:** Practicing real-world inspired data cleaning challenges daily to master preprocessing, wrangling, and transformation for Data Science & Analytics.


## Overview

This repository contains my **daily data cleaning challenges** inspired by real-world datasets. Each challenge simulates messy, inconsistent, or incomplete data, and I document the process of transforming it into analysis-ready form.

---

## Skills & Tools

* **Languages:** Python (Pandas, NumPy)
* **Libraries:** Faker, datetime, re, pyjanitor
* **Techniques:**

  * Handling missing values
  * Removing duplicates
  * Fixing data types
  * String/text cleaning
  * Outlier detection & treatment
  * Feature transformation & encoding


## Daily Challenge Structure

Each day’s folder contains:

1. **dataset/** – Raw and cleaned CSV files.
2. **notebook/** – Jupyter Notebook documenting the cleaning process.
3. **notes.md** – Summary of learnings from the day’s challenge.



## Learning Goals

* Build muscle memory for fast, accurate cleaning.
* Simulate real-world messiness (typos, mixed formats, outliers).
* Develop reproducible cleaning scripts for portfolio use.
